        <h2>Welcome to Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure</h2>
        <p class="sub">Discover the latest advancements in industry, infrastructure and innovation around the world.</p>
        <p id="firstcontent">The world is changing rapidly, and the way we build, grow, and develop needs to change with it.  This is the core message behind Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.
            At the heart of this goal lies the understanding that a strong foundation is essential for progress.  Resilient infrastructure, like reliable transportation networks, clean water systems, and sustainable energy grids, provides the  backbone for a thriving society.
        </p>

    <p>But a strong foundation is just the beginning.  We also need sustainable industrialization.  This means creating industries that are not only efficient and productive, but also environmentally conscious and socially responsible.  Imagine factories that use less energy and produce fewer pollutants, while still creating good jobs with fair wages.</p>
    <p>The key to unlocking both resilient infrastructure and sustainable industry is fostering innovation.  New technologies and ideas can help us build smarter, cleaner, and more efficient systems.  From renewable energy sources to advanced manufacturing techniques, innovation holds the power to transform our world.</p>
    <p>However,  Goal 9 goes beyond just building things.  It emphasizes that these advancements must be accessible to all people.  We need to create an industrial landscape that offers opportunities for everyone, regardless of background or circumstance.  This means investing in education and training, and ensuring that the benefits of progress are shared widely</p>
    <blockquote>

            “The only sustainable competitive advantage is your ability to learn faster than your competitors.” <br>- Peter Drucker
        </p>
        <hr />
      </blockquote>
      <p>Investments in infrastructure – transport, irrigation, energy and information and communication technology – are crucial to achieving sustainable development and empowering communities in many countries. To achieve Goal 9 by 2030, it is also essential to support LDCs, invest in advanced technologies, lower carbon emissions and increase mobile broadband access.</p>
    <p>Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources.

        The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. If industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment</p>
    <p>In conclusion,  Goal 9 is a call to action for a future where strong infrastructure, sustainable industries, and cutting-edge innovation work together to create a more prosperous, equitable, and resilient world.  By investing in these areas, we can ensure that everyone has the chance to benefit from a growing economy and a healthy planet</p>

        <h3 class="list-title">INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE:</h3>
        <p>WHY IT MATTERS</p>
        <ul class="lists">
        <li><h4>What’s the goal here? </h4><p>To build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and
            sustainable industrialization and foster innovation</p></li>
        <li><h4>Why?</h4><p>Economic growth, social
            development and climate
            action are heavily dependent on investments in
            infrastructure, sustainable
            industrial development and
            technological progress.In the face of a rapidly
            changing global economic
            landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained
            growth must include industrialization that first of all,
            makes opportunities accessible to all people, and two,
            is supported by innovation
            and resilient infrastructure.</p></li>
        <li><h4>So what’s the problem?</h4><p>Basic infrastructure
            like roads, information
            and communication technologies, sanitation,
            electrical power and
            water remains scarce in
            many developing countries. Approximately 1.2
            billion people do not have
            access to reliable phone
            services. 2.3 billion people
            worldwide lack access
            to basic sanitation and
            almost 800 million lack
            access to water. In developing countries, barely
            30 per cent of agricultural
            production undergoes
            industrial processing. 
            </p></li>
        <li><h4>Why should I care?</h4><p>It’s about our livelihoods.
            The growth of new industries means improvement
            in the standard of living
            for many of us. Also, if
            industries pursue sustainability, this approach will
            have a positive effect on
            the environment. Climate
            change affects all us.</p></li>
            <li><h4>What is the price
                of inaction?</h4><p>The price is steep. Ending
                    poverty would be more
                    difficult, given the industry’s role as a core driver
                    of the global development agenda to eradicate
                    poverty and advance
                    sustainable development.Additionally, failing to
                    improve infrastructure
                    and promote technological innovation could
                    translate into poor
                    health care, inadequate
                    sanitation and limited
                    access to education. </p></li>
        <li><h4>How can we help?</h4><p>Establish standards and
            promote regulations that
            ensure company projects and initiatives are
            sustainably managed.
            Collaborate with NGOs
            and the public sector
            to help promote sustainable growth within
            developing countries.
            Think about how industry impacts on your life
            and well-being and use
            social media to push
            for policymakers to prioritize the SDGs.</p></li>
